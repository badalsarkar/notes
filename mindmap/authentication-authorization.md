      - what
         - Identity layer
            - functions
               - authentication done be Authorization server
               - verifies identity of end user
               - obtain basic profile information about end user
                    in REST like manner
               - receive information about authenticated sessions
                    and end users
         - extenstion to OAuth2
         - Only focused on Authentication
         - introduces
            - JWT
            - standard endpoints
               - /login, /token/, /userinfo
            - standard scopes
               - openid, profile, email
            - ID token
               - it only identifies who a person is not access
            - single logout
      - clients
         - Web client
         - mobile
         - Javascript
      - implementations
         - certified implementations
            - PingFederate
            - and many more (https://openid.net/developers/certified/ )
      - provider
         - provides
            - stores user credential
            - Manage login security
            - manages user registration
            - manages integration with LDAP/ SAML
            - manages password reset process
            - implements 2 factor authentication
            - SSO (Single Sign On)
               - integrated through
                  - cloud company
                     - Google
                     - Github

                     - AuthO
                     - Any OpenID Connect Certified provider
                     - PingFederate
      - flows
         - Authorization Code
            - similar to OAuth2 Authorization Code flow
            - This enables SSO
            - The client gets back an ID token
         - Hybrid flow
            - returns both ID token and access token
- specification
   - Roles
      - Resource owner
      - Resource Server
      - Authorization Server
      - Client/ Application
   - Tokens
      - Access Token
         - Bearer Token
            - whoever have the token owns the token
         - JWT Token
         - Opaque Token
      - Refresh Token
   - Scopes
      - what
         - what is allowed to do
         - A permitted authority or action
         - usually "." separated example calendar.readonly
      - how is it applied
   - Grant types
      - Client Credentials
         - Simplest flow
         - Service to service communication
         - The client has to be trusted
         - how it works?
            - each client has id and secret
            - id & secret used to retrieve access token
      - Authorization Code
         - Browser based login
         - for SPAs
         - Confidential
         - Secure
         - Makes heavy use of browser ridirects and back channels
         - User typically approves the scopes to the client
      - Device code
         - Televisions and env with limited input capability
      - Refresh
         - obtain new token when one expires
      - Password
         - less secure
         - for CLI, SPAs
         - how it works?
            - User provide credentials to client
            - client use the credential to retrive access token from authorization server
            - user must trust the client absolutely
      - Implicit
         - similar to Authorization Code flow

## Spring security
- Built in OAuth Support
   - Recommended for new app
- Spring Security OAuth
- integrations
   - login
      - SSO
   - client
      - access OAuth2 protected resources
   - resource server
