## Sets

A collection of things with similar characterstics

- infinite set: {a, b, c, .....}
- finite set: {a,b,c}

- Numerical set:
- Universal set: a set of everyting that is relevent to our question

**complex numbers**: a real number + an imaginary number. 7 + 3i.

- subset: every member of A is member of B. So A is subset of B. A is also subset of A.
- proper subset: every element of A is member of B and B has at least one element that is not member
of A. A is not proper subset of A.
- empty set: empty set is subset of every set including itself.

- equality: if two sets have same members

- order: in set order means number of elements in the sets (cardinality). Infinite set has infinite
cardinality/order.  finite set has finite cardinality/order.

## Function

It relates input to the output.

f(x)=x^2-> here f is function name, x is input, x^2 is the output.  x=x^2 -> this is also function
without a function name

- a function takes elements of sets and gives back elements of sets
- formal definition of function: A function relates each element of a set to exactly one element to
another set(possibly) the same set.

## Polynomial

It means many terms.

Polynomial can have constant, variable, and exponent and are related by addition, substraction,
           multiplication, and division except division by variable.

### Multiplying Polynomials


## Coefficient

It is a number used to multiply a variable.  Example: `4x-7 = 5`

Here `4` is coefficient of x.

## What is proof? Why we need it

## Permutaion and Combination

In permutation the order matters. Permutation can be with repetition or without repetition.

Formula:\n With repetition: n^r, where n is the total available choice and r is the number of times
the choice will be picked up.

Without repetition: n!/(n-r)!\n

In combination the order doesn't matter.

## Factor

Factors are the numbers you multiply together to get another number:

2 X 3 = 6; Here 2 and 3 are the factors.

Factors usually positive or negative and no negative numbers.

## Proportional Relation

When quantities have same ratio, it is called proportional relationship.
