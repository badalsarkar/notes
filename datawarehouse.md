# Data Warehouse

- 3 step data warehousing process
  - Staging: accumulating data from various sources using the ETL technique and stored in staging area. This is intermediate store.
  - Data transform/ warehouse: Moving staged data to warehouse. The warehouse maybe dimensional, normalized, data mart or other data store.
  - Data provisioning: Making the transformed data available for consumption. The consumption can be done by OLAP, another data warehouse, or multi-dimensional database.
- Types of data warehouse
  - based on processing type: real-time vs batch
  - storage format: columnar vs row-based
  - data structure: relational vs NO-SQL
  - Deployment options: On-premises vs Cloud
- In-memory database
- Cubes
  - OLAP Cubes is multi-dimensional dataset.
  - Data is not stored as table but as array
  - Main reason to use is fast query performance
  - Data is pre-calculated (aggregated values)
  - Good for use case where there is interactive tool, data has hierarchy and we need to slice & dice the data
  - Uses MDX language, developed by Microsoft
  - multi-dimensional DBs, for which hardware requirement is also different
  - Used in data marts
  - Cubes are less important today as there are alternatives like columnar storage, In-memory database, tabular model etc
- ODS (operational data storage)
  - note data warehouse
  - Used for operational decision making, not for analytical decision making
  - Long history not needed
  - Need for real-time data
  - Data can go from ODS to warehouse
- ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) process
  - There are many tools for each task of ETL
  - Load
    - Delta load
      - Incremental loading of data
- Massive Parallel Processing (MPP)
  - Shared disk architecture
  - Shared nothing architecture
- Consideration for selecting data warehouse
  - Data format
    - Is your data structured or unstructured?
    - Is it relational or non-relational?
    - What does the warehouse support?
  - Price
    - assess your storage and processing needs
    - prioritize scalability
    - balance setup cost and long term operational cost
  - Performance
    - Assess the volume of data you need to store
    - The frequency of queries
    - The response time requirement
    - Assess how well the data warehouse handles queries of different complexities and data size
    - Go for warehouse that supports MPP
- Security
  - Look for built in support for encryption, authentication, and authorization features
  - Follows the industry regulations
  - Supports audit trails and monitoring
- Processing type
  - batch processing is good for handling large volume of data at once
  - real-time processing provides immediate insight
  - consider the nature of data and the speed at which you need result
- Integration
  - How well does it integrate with other tools like BI tools, visualization tools, ingestion tools etc.
- Types of analysis
  - Descriptive analysis
    - Aggregation
    - Reporting
    - Data visualization
  - Diagnostic analysis
    - Answers questions like "Why did it happen"
    - Common techniques includes Data mining, Correlation analysis, Statistical analysis
  - Predictive analysis
    - Answers questions like "What could happen"
    - Common techniques are regression analysis, time series analysis, machine learning algorithms
  - Prescriptive analysis
    - Answers questions like "What should happen"
    - Common techniques includes optimization algorithms, simulation modeling, decision trees
  - Exploratory analysis
  - Comparative analysis
- Data access scenario refers to
  - what queries are made, how often and at what proportion
  - how much data is read for each query- rows, columns, and bytes
  - the relationship between reading and updating data
  - the working size of data and how locally it is used
  - whether transactions are used and how isolated they are
  - requirements for data replication and logical integrity
  - requirements for latency and throughput for each query
