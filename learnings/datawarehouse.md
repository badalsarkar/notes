# Data Warehouse

- In-memory database
- Cubes
  - OLAP Cubes is multi-dimensional dataset.
  - Data is not stored as table but as array
  - Main reason to use is fast query performance
  - Data is pre-calculated (aggregated values)
  - Good for use case where there is interactive tool, data has hierarchy and we need to slice & dice the data
  - Uses MDX language, developed by Microsoft
  - multi-dimensional DBs, for which hardware requirement is also different
  - Used in data marts
  - Cubes are less important today as there are alternatives like columnar storage, In-memory database, tabular model etc
- ODS (operational data storage)
  - note data warehouse
  - Used for operational decision making, not for analytical decision making
  - Long history not needed
  - Need for real-time data
  - Data can go from ODS to warehouse
- ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) process
  - There are many tools for each task of ETL
  - Load
    - Delta load
      - Incremental loading of data
- Massive Parallel Processing (MPP)
  - Shared disk architecture
  - Shared nothing architecture
