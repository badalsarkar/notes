+ Bitwise Operators
++ what
+++ Perform operation on integer at individual bit level
++ operators
+++ "|" bitwise OR
++++ The result is 1 is one of the input in 1
+++ "&" bitwise AND
++++ The result is 1 if both of the input is 1
+++ "^" bitwise XOR
++++ The result is 0 if both input is either 1 or 0
+++ "~" bitwise Compliment
++++ change 1 to 0 and 0 to 1
+++ "<<" left shift
++++ shifts all bits to left by specified number
++++ discards left most (Most significant bit)
++++ add 0 to the right most bit(Leat significant bit)
+++ ">>" signed right shift
++++ shifts all the bits to the right by specified number
++++ discards the right most bit
++++ when a bit is shifted, the left most bit is replaced with sign bit
+++ ">>>" unsigned right shift
++++ shifts all the bits to right by specified number
++++ discards the right most bit
++++ replace the vacant left position with 0
