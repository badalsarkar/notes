* recursion
** types
*** linear recursion
**** recursive function call itself only once
**** head recursion
***** the recursive call is the first call
****** the operation is done at function return time
***** not easily convertable to loop
**** tail recursion
***** the recursive call is the last
****** the operation is done at function call time
***** easily converted to loop
***** loop is more efficient
****** time complexity same
****** space complexity is constant
**** tree recursion
***** recursive function calls itself more than once
***** space complexity O(n)
**** indirect recursion
*****_ multiple recursive function calling each other in circular fashion
**** nested recursion
*****_ a recursive call taking another recursive call as parameter
** data structure
*** uses stack
