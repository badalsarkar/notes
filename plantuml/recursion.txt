* recursion
** types
    *** head recursion
        **** the recursive call is the first call
            ***** the operation is done at function return time
        **** not easily convertable to loop
    *** tail recursion
        **** the recursive call is the last
            ***** the operation is done at function call time
        **** easily converted to loop
        **** loop is more efficient
            ***** time complexity same
            ***** space complexity is constant
** data structure
*** uses stack
