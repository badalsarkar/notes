# graph

## [[images/graph-type.png | types]]
- Undirected
- Directed
- Weighted
- Self loop

## Tree
- traits
   - non-linear?
   - for hierarchical data
   - can't contain cycle
   - node may or may not contain link to parent
- [[images/tree-terminology.png | tree terminology]]
   - root
   - leaf
      - node with no children
   - parent
   - child
   - edge
   - height
   - depth
- types
   - binary tree
      - what?
         - each node has up to two child
            - it can have 0, 1 or 2 children
      - types
         - binary search tree
            - what?
               - all left child <= parent
               - all right child > parent
            - tips
               - normally contains no duplicate
               - if there is duplicate it can be in either side of a node
               - clarify this before solving problem
         - complete binary tree
            - what?
               - every level, except last one, is full
               - must be filled from left to right
               - has $O(\log n)$ height
            - type
               - Max heap
                  - elements are in descending order
                  - each node > children
                  - root is the maximum element
                  - operations
                     - insert
                        - $O(\log n)$
                     - extract_max
                        - $O(\log n)$
               - Min heap
                  - elements are in ascending order
                  - each node is < children
                  - root is the minimum element
                  - operations
                     - insert/ add
                        -
                           -
                              - 1. insert element at the right most position
                           -
                              - to maintain completeness
                        -
                           - 2. swap with parent until it goes to the correct position
                        - $O(\log n)$ , where $n$ = no. of nodes in the tree
                     - extract_min/ poll
                        - extract the root and re-organize the tree
                        -
                           -
                              - 1. swap root with lowermost rightmost element
                           -
                              - this preserves the complete binary tree property
                        -
                           - 2. compare and swap root with one of its children
                        -
                           - 3. do this until min heap property is restored
                        - $O(\log n)$
         - full binary tree
            - what?
               - a node has either 0 or 2 child
         - perfect binary tree
            - what?
               - it both complete binary tree and full binary tree
      - traversal
         - Pre-order
            - current node -> left branch -> right branch
         - In-order
            - left branch -> current node -> right branch
         - Post-order
            - left branch -> right branch -> current node
      - search
         - DFS
            - visits the neighbor before visiting the children
            - use a queue
               - add the children of current to the queue
               - dequeue an item to visit it
            - this is called level order traversal
         - BFS
            - finish a branch before moving to next branch
            - implemented using pre-order, in-order and post-order traversal
   - balanced tree
      - traits
         - guarantee $O(\log n)$ insertion and find
         - doesn't mean they are totally balanced
         - when the difference of the height of left sub-tree
             and right sub-tree is no more than 1
      - types
         - red-black tree
         - AVL tree

## implementation
- commonly represented by
   - adjacency matrix
   - adjacency list
      - can be represented by Array, Hashmap, LinkedList
         - Sub title

## what
- represents collection of nodes connected with edge
- it can contain cycle
- terminology
   - vertex
      - represents information
   - edge
      - connection between nodes
         - unidirectional
            - AKA directed graph
         - bi-directional
            - AKA undirected graph
