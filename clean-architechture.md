# Clean Architecture 

Developing fast often lead to technical debt.

- Every software system provides two different values to the stakeholders:
behavior and structure(architecture). Software developers are responsible for ensuring that
both those values remain high.

## Programming Paradigm

- Paradigms are ways of programming, relatively unrelated to languages
- Three paradigms: structured, object oriented and functional

>Structured programming imposes discipline on direct transfer of control.
>Object-oriented programming imposes discipline on indirect transfer of control.
