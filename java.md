# JAVA

## Introduction

1. Byte code: This is not machine code. This is highly optimized set of instructions to be executed
   by JVM (java virtual machine).
2. Java is platform independent by the way of using JVM. JVM is platform dependent.
3. Java codes are run in JRE(java runtime environment) which includes JVM.
4. Java ensures high security because the codes are run inside JRE, which restricts code's access to
   the machine.
5. To optimize performance, Java does JIT (Just in Time) compilation. This is a method to compile a
   certain portion of code into machine code, on-the-fly.
6. Another compilation method is Ahead-of-Time compilation. This means the compilation is done
   before running the application.
7. Servlet- a small java program that runs on the server. This program extends the functionality of
   the server.
8. Applet- a small java program that is downloaded at client side. This program provides different
   functionality on the client side.
9. Jlink- A tool for deployment of java code over internet. It creates an image of runtime.
10. Varibale declaration- same as c++
11. If, for - same as c++
12. Semicolon and space - same as c++

## Data Types and Operators

Java is strongly typed. All operations are type checked at compile time. Java has 8 primitive types-
4 int, 2 floating point, 1 char, 1 boolean.

### Int

4 types-

- int
- short
- long
- byte (used for low level file handling or for large arrays when storage space is at premium)
- Java doesn't support unsigned int.
- Char is unsigned 16 bit. Java uses unicode not ASCII. It uses unicode because java was designed to
be used for internet.

The range for integer doesn't depend on the platform on which the program runs. In C/C++ the size
of integer will change based on the processor type. 16 bit processor will have different integer
range than a 32 bit integer.

### Floating Point

Two types-

- Float
- Double

Floating point numbers are not suitable for financial calculations as the round off error is not
accepted. For that use the BigDecimal type.

*strictfp* keyword denotes that method/class must use the strict-floating point calculation that
yield reproducible result.

### Literal

These are fixed values. They are commonly known as constants.  Character literals are written as
'c'. The default integer literal are of type int. If we want to specify long we should write like
100L. The default floating type literal is double. To specify float we should write 10.29F.

We can use underscore in integer or floating point literal. Underscors are used as seperator and are
discarded during compile time. For example, 123_45_678 is same as 12345678.

### Char

Char literal is surrounded by single quote. 'A' is a char literal whereas "A" is a String.

![Char](./images/char.png "Char") ![Char](./images/char2.phg "Char")

#### Unicode and Char type

It is best to use String to work with text. Use char type when you are manipulating UTF-16 code
units....

### Boolean

Java doesn't allow conversion between boolean and integer.

### Initializing Variable

Java doesn't allow uninitialized variable. All declared variables must be initialized. But this
doesn't mean that the declaration and initialization must happen in the same line.

### Enumerated Types

Enumerated type variable can hold any value from a set of pre-defined values or null.

### Hex, Octal, Binary

Java allows to specify integer literal using hex, oct or binary. See following example-

```Java

hex= 0xFF   //this is equivalent to 255 in decimal oct= 011    //this is equivalent to 9 in decimal.
The leading 0 indicates octal binary= 0b1100 //this is equivalent to 12 in decimal. 
```

### Scope and Lifetime of Variable

Java has class scope and method scope. Method scope is same as the block scope.  One important thing
is that there is no shadowing in case of block scope. We can't declare a variable with same name in
outer and inner block. This will result in compilation error. Details of class scope will come
later.

### Operators

Four operator class- Arithmatic, Bitwise, Logical, Relational a.

#### Arithmatic

- Prefix and postfix
- Logical: &, |, ^(xor), ||(short circuit Or), &&(short circuit And), !

**Short Circuit Logical Operator**: In an logical operation, the short circuite operator will check
the second operand only when necessary. But the normal operator will always check both the operands.

### Type Conversion

**Conversion between numeric types**: In the following image, the solid arrow means that conversion
doesn't lead to any precision loss. The dotted arrow means the conversion will lose precision.

![Numeric Conversion](./images/NumericConvirsion.png "Numeric Conversion")

**Type conversion in assignment:** Java only allows widening conversion. Meaning the destination
type is larger than converted type.  Java does not allow conversion between integer and boolean if
the two types are compatible and widening conversion is possible, Java will do the conversion
automatically.

**Conversion of incompatible types**: Use casting. (type) (expression/ target type). Example- `(int)
(double)`

**Type conversion in expression:** Java follows promotion policy. Lower order types are converted to
higher order types.  First, all char, byte, and short values are promoted to int. Then, if one
operand is a long, the whole expression is promoted to long. If one operand is a float operand, the
entire expression is promoted to float. If any of the operands is double, the result is double.  The
type promotion only affects the expression evaluation. Outside the expression the variable type is
still the same.

**Important: expression with two byte and char type will result to int type. So casting may be
needed in assignment.**

#### Bitwise operator

Need to read about it.

### Strings

Strings are object instantiated from String class. In Java any object can be converted into String.
Strings are immutable.

- string.equals(string): compares two strings.Don't use == operator to commpare strings. Because
                         this compares the address of the variables not the value.

#### Building Strings

If you want to build string from many smaller strings or chars, use the StringBuilder class. String
concatenation is not efficient.

### Input Output

Use Scanner class to read input from console. If you want to read password from console, use
System.console(). See the following example-

![Scanner class](./images/scanner.png "Console class to read password")

#### File input and output

Use PrintWriter class to write to file.

#### Formatting Output

### Program Control Statement

1. Keyboard input:Java keyboard inputs are line buffered. Inputs are stored into temporary buffer.
Inputs are received as integer. We need to convert to char if we are expecting char.
2. If, Switch, For:for the for loop the initialization, condition and iteration can be empty.  we
can use 'break' to exit the loop.

### Big Numbers

BigInteger, BigDecimal

### Classes, Objects, Methods

#### Nested class

- Static nested class
- Non-static nested class -inner class


## More Data Type and Operators

### Array
   
1.  Array:<br> The syntax is<br> `type identifier[]= new type[size];` <br> with initialization
list<br> `type identifier[]= {val1, val2,....,valn};`<br>

    - Array is a reference variable
    - Array is passed by value in a function. Pass by value means the reference of the array is
    copied not the elements
    - Multidimensional array- `type identifier[][] = new type [r][c];`<br>. 
    - array.length on multidimensional array returns the number of rows.  array[index].lenght
    returns the number of columns in the specified row.

2. Ragged Array: A multidimensional array where the length of the column index can vary. When we
declare multidemsional array, we must specify r from \[r\]\[c\]. The value of 'c' can be specified
later. See the following example

 ```java int numbers[][]= new int [10][];

 numbers[0]= new int [5]; //the length of number[0] is 5 numbers[1]= new int [2]; //the length of
 the numbers[1] is 2 .... 
```

3. Alternative array declaration syntax: ```java int counter[]=new int [4]; int [] counter; int []
counter, anotherCounter; //creates two arrays ```

4. **In java, arrays are implemented as object**

5. For each loop- we can user the 'break' keyword to stop the loop <br>
6. For each loop is read only- any change in the iteration variable will not reflect on the original
variable. <br>
7. In multidimensional array, use the enhanced for loop the following way-

```java 
int num[][]= new int[5][5]; 
for(int i[]:num){ for(int j:i){ //do something here //notice thedeclaration of i and j 
  } 
} 
```

#### String

1. String is object in Java.
2. Create string using any of the following method ```java String a= new String("some string");
String b= new String(a); String c= "Some String"; ```

**String.equal() vs ==** String.equal matches individual characters sequence whereas == matches the
reference which means whether two variables are referring to the same address.

3. Java string is immutable. Read about immutability
[here](https://github.com/badalsarkar/Software-Engineering-Concepts/blob/master/mutability/mutability.md).

4. Strings can be used in switch statement. However, this can reduce performance. It is better to
use integer in switch.<br>
5. Command line arguments are stored in an array of Strings

6. Type inference: Use the var keyword the. It can be used for array declaration as `var myarray=
new int [10]`. Type inference is not allowed in instance variable, parameter declaration, return
type.


#### Bitwise Operator

###### Java Scanner Class    

Java provides many ways to read input. Scanner class is one of them. It is found in the java.util
package. This class provides numerous methods to read input. To use it we need to instantiate an
object by passing the input stream. 

```java import java.util.Scanner;

Scanner input= new Scanner(System.in);  //to read input from keyboard

input.netx();       //read next word ```

## Objects and Classes

We can define class in the same file. A class can be defined before using or after using.

```java //class can be declared before or after /* class Person{ String name; int age; } */

    class classExample{ public static void main(String args[]){ Person badal= new Person();
      badal.name="Badal"; badal.age=33; System.out.println("The name is : " + badal.name);
      System.out.println("The age is : " + badal.age); } }

    class Person{ String name; int age; }

```

In a void method, we can use 'return' keyword to terminate the function and return control back to
the caller. There can be multiple 'return' keyword in a function

**Constructor**: Java provides default constructor and initialize the object with default value 0
for numeric, null for reference type, false for boolean type. The constructor syntax is similar to
c++.

**Important: Objects are dynamically created in Java. So they stay in heap.  But in c++ objects are
statically created.**

**object creation steps in Java:**

- class-type Identifier: This just creates a variable that can refer to an object of the class-type.
unlike c++ this does not create object.
- identifier= new class-type(); //this creates object and return a reference to it and assigns to
identifier.  //now the identifier refers to an object

**Garbage Collection:** This is a process to free up memory occupied by objects.  When no reference
to an object exists, garbage collection process frees up the memory. This process happens if two
conditions are met- 1) no reference to object exists and 2) there is reason to recycle them. Garbage
collection process takes time to execute. Therefore, Java runtime only does when appropriate.

**Method Signature:** Method signature consists of method name and parameter list.  Types of
Methods:

- Instance Method: Object level method, can access instance variables
- Static Method: Class level method, can't access instance variables, can access static variables.
Object instantiation is not required. To call *classname.methodname()*.  Relationship between
classes: The most common relationships are
- Dependence ("uses-a"): When a class uses another class's methods. Good design practice is to
minimize the number of classes that depend on each other. This is called lose coupling. Strong
coupling introduces bugs because change in one class affects another class.
- Aggregation ("has-a"): One class contains object of another class.
- Inheritance ("is-a"): One class receives properties and methods from another class.

Mutator method- a method that changes the value Accessor method- a method that reads the value

 **The JIT compiler watches for methods that are short, commonly called and not overridden and
 optimizes them away** **Be very careful about not return a reference to a mutable object from
 accessor method, if you need to return a reference to a mutable object, you should clone it first**

 Class Employee{ ...  public Date getHireDate(){ return (Date) hireDate.clone(); } ...  }

question: what is the return type of clone() method?
10. Java uses 'final' keyword to declare constant. Constant means further assignment is not
possible.
11. Static Modifier: Makes a variable a class variable. Same as C++.
12. Static Method: These methods operate on classes not on objects. Meaning, we don't need to
instantiate an object to call these methods. Static methods can only access static variables.  **Use
static method on two situations- 1) When the method doesn't need to access the instance variable, 2)
when a method only needs to access the static variables**
13. Factory method: When we want to instantiate different type of object from same class, we use the
factory method. In this design, there is no constructor to the class, rather there are different
static methods that creates an object and returns it. The class works as a factory to create
different types objects. See the following example

    NumberFormat currencyFormatter= NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance(); NumberFormat
    percentFormatter= NumberFormat.getPercentInstance();

here the same we are instantiating a NumberFormat object but using two different methods. To fulfill
this purpose, we can't use constructor because constructor can't be named, also we can't vary the
type of object constructed.

The main method is static because it doesn't work on any object. When the program starts there is no
object. So, the main method has to be static.
14. Method Parameters: There are two types of parameters- primitive types and object reference type.
Three things to remember-
    - A method can't modify a parameter of primitive type
    - A method can change the state of an object parameter
    - A method can't make an object paramter refer to new object
15. Default field initialization: If it is a instance variable it is initialized to 0 or false or
null. If it is local variable, it has to be initialized explicitly. Otherwise there will be
compilation error.
16. If constructor is overloaded, the default constructor is not provided by compiler.
17. Packages- a collection of classes
18. Importing packages- we use the 'import' statement. We can import a class, a specific method,
  static methods and fields
19. To add a class into a package, add 'package *package name*' statement at the top of the file
that contains the classes.
20. Some guidelines for designing classes-
    - Always keep data private
    - Always initialize data Java initializes the instance variable with default value. But don't
    depend on the default value.  initialize in the constructor or variable declaration.
    - Don't use too many basic types in a class If you can group them together in a seperate class.
    See to following example- private String street; private String city; private String state;
    private int zip; The above can be put into a class called address.
    - Not all fields need accessor and mutator
    - Break up the class if it is doing multiple things
    - Make the name of your class and methods reflect their responsibility
    - Make class immutable if possible. To do this make all instance variable immutable. If client
    code needs to change the value, return a new object with updated data. Immutable objects are
    thread safe.  
    - Override the *equals* method and the *toString* method defined in the *Object* class.
21. Calling constructor from inside a constructor: use the "this" keyword.  `this(arguments)`
22. Java access modifiers: [see this
link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/215497/what-is-the-difference-between-public-protected-package-private-and-private-in)


## Inheritance

- To invoke a base class method, we use the *super* keyword.  `super.somemethod()`. In C++ the same
is done using the *::* operator. `Base::somemethod()`.
- *Dynamic binding* is the default behaviour in Java. Dynamic binding means during the runtime,
  automatically selecting the correct type to call method. In C++ to enable dynamic binding we need
  to make the method virtual at the base class. 
- Multiple Inheritance: Java doesn't support multiple inheritance. But provides a different
mechanism to provide the functionality of multiple inheritance. This is called *Interface*. In C++
multiple inheritance is allowed.

## Polymorphism

- An object having multiple form.

        ```java super objname= superobject;     //valid super objname= subobject;       //valid

        objname.supermethod(); //valid objname.submethod(); //invalid ```

- **Method call**: It is very important ot understand how the method call works because the concept
is related to polymorphism.
    
    step 1: The compiler looks at the declared type of the object and the method name. The compiler
    enumerates all the methods whith the same name in the class and all superclasses.
    
    step 2: Next, compiler determines the type of the argument that are suplied in the method call.
    If there is a unique method among all the methods, that method is called. This process is called
    overloading resolution. If there is no matching parameter, the compiler generates an error. At
    this point the compiler knows the method name and the argument type. 
    
    step 3: If the method is private, static, final or a constructor, then the compiler knows
    exactly which mehtod to call. This is called *static binding*. Otherwise the method to be called
    depends on the type of the implicit parameter.  Dynamic binding is used to determine the type.
    The compiler just generates an instructon to call the method with dynamic binding. 
    
    step 4: When the program runs, the virtual machine must call the method on the actual type of
    the object. If it, can't find the mehtod in the class, it searches the method in the super class
    and calls. To make this process more efficent Java uses a method table, a table that lists all
    the method name available to a class and the actual method that it refers to. 

- The methods those are private, static, final and constructor are staticaly bound. Because the
compiler knows exactly which method to call. 

- When we override a super class method in a subclass, the accessibility must be same or less
restrictive than super class method. A subclass may change the return type of the method to subtype
or original type.For example-

```java public Employee getbuddy(){} //in subclass public Manager getbuddy(){} //ok to change the
return type ```



- Preventing inheritance: There may be instances when we dno't want any class to be inherited from a
calss. To do that we need to make that class *final*. `public final class{}` -> this class is marked
as *final*. So, no class can be extended from this class. Marking a class *final* makes all its
methods *final*. Final methods can't be overridden. 

If you don't want polymorphic behaviour for a function, you can make it final.  In C++ functions are
not polymorphic by default. We have to explicitely make it polymorphic by declaring as *virtual*.
Declaring functions as *final* has some performance benefits. There is no need for dynamic binding.
And the compiler can optimize the method call, if it is short.  This is called *inlining*. Although
the JIT compiler can perform this optimization even if functions are overridden in subclass. 

- **Casting**: Use casting when you want to convert superclass object to subclass object. `subclass
object=(subclass) superclass object`.

Java automatically cast the sub class to super calss. We need to manually cast the super class to
the sub class. As casting deals with type system, it is checked during compile time. If we are
casting down the inheritance chain and trying to cast an object which is not related, java runtime
thorws a ClassCastException error and the program terminates.  It, is therefore necessay to check
the object type before casting.

```java Employee []staff = new Employee [5]; staff[0]= new Employee(); Manager boss; if(staff[0]
    instanceof Manager) boss= (Manager) staff[0]; 
```

- Abstract method and Abstract class- Abstract methods are implemented in the subclass. If a class
has an  abstract method,the class must be declared as abstract calss. We can't instantiate an object
from abstract class. It is possible to declare a class as abstract even if there is no abstract
method. If a subclass doesn't implement all the abstract methods from super class, that subclass
also must be abstract class. A subclass becomes a concrete class when it defiles all the abstract
methods from super class. We can create a variable of abstract type but that must refer to a
concrete sub-class.

- A subclass can be abstract even if its super class is concrete 
- A concrete method can be overriden as abstract
- Access modifier: Java has four access modifier- public, private, protected,
  default(package-private) public: visible to world private: visible to class only protected:
    visible to all classes in the same package(package-private) and by its sub-class from another
    package

                   It is important to remember that a sub-class from another package can only access
                   the protected variable of the object instantiated from the sub-class itself, not
                   of super class object or other object derived from same super class. An example
                   will make this clear

                   Employee class is a super class that declares hireDate as protected field.
                   Manager class is derived from Employee class in the same package Administrator is
                   derived from the Employee class but in different package. 

                   Now, the methods of the Administrator class can access teh hireDate field
                   directly only of the Administrator objects. Not Employee object or Manager
                   object.  This mechanism ensures that someone can't get access to the protected
                   fields just by forming subclasses.

                   Protected methods make more sense. If a method is tricky to use, you can make it
                   protected. This means only the class with good knowledge about their ancestors
                   can use this method. 


        default: visible to all classes with the package [more about access
        modifier](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/accesscontrol.html)

- Cosmic superclass- In Java, every class extends the Object class. It is the default. But the
primitive types(number, character, boolean) are not object.
        
        Object class has a "equals" method. This method checks if two objects are identical meaning
        if their reference is same. But this equality check may not work for all object type. For
        some object we want to find state based equality.  For this, we should override the "equals"
        method as per our need. 

## Interface

Java interfaces are requirements for classes. The classes those implements an interface conforms to
the requirements.

- Interfaces can't be instantiated
- Interface can be used as type and it is a reference type
- Interface can contain the following- 
  a. Public static final variable (the variables are by default public static final) 
  b. private method 
  c. private static method(as of java SE8) 
  d. public static abstract method (methods are by default public and abstract) 
  e. default method: These methods povide a function body. This is useful as these methods doesn't
  have to be defined in the implementing classes.

- The class that implements interface, must define all the methods
- In java interface is a solution for multiple inheritance
- If there is name conflict between interface and superclass, superclass always wins.
- if there is name conflict between two interfaces, compiler will throw an error and the programmer
has to select one methods explicitly.

**Some Interfaces**<br>
- The interface "ActionListener" provides a callback function facility
- Comparator interface: provides a method called "compare" we can define it for custom comparision
- Clonable interface


### Lambda Expression/Closures

- an anonymous function which defines the functional interface
- functional interface is an interface which has only one abstract method.
- interface can have multiple private, static and default methods. But these are not abstract
method. So, a functional interface can also have multiple of these methods.
- lambda expression doesn't need any parameter type
- the return type of a lambda expression is always inferred. It is never specified.
- A lambda expression is always used in a context where the target type is specified. This is used
to infer the return type.
- when a lambda expression, an instance of a class is automatically created. This class implements
the functional interface
- Lambda expression can capture instance variable, instance methods of enclosing class and
effectively final local vari able defined in the enclosing class/block.
- lambda expression can change instance variable value but can't modify the local variable. 
- We can't make lambda function generic. However, we can make the functional inteface generic and
thus can use one lambda expression for multiple types

    aDE0bGV2MXNlYzZfaHRtbCZxdWVyeT0=)

#### Method Reference: Need to study further

- A way to refer to a method instead of calling it instantly. It can be used in place of lambda
expression.
- Three type of method reference- static method, instance method, constructor reference
- java.util.function has several predifined functional interface.


#### Constructor Reference

## Generics

- It parameterized type which means the type information is passed as parameter.
- The type can only be reference type not premitive type. For example, we need to use Integer as
type instead of int.
- Wrape the primitive type with a type wraper. TODO: java autoboxing and auto-unboxing is related to
that.
- Generic type differ based on their type argument. 

#### Raw Type

#### Type Erasure

#### Generic Method The systax is `access modifier Type parameter return type name(argument list){}`
`public static <T extends Comparable<T>, V extends T> boolean compare(T[], V[]){}`

#### Generic Constructor The syntax is `<T extends Number> name(T var){};`

#### Generic Interface

The systax is `interface name<T>{}`

#### Bounded Types

- We can restrict the type that can be passed to generic class. For example, if we want our class to
have only numbers, i.e int, double, float etc, we can use the bounded types syntax.
- In bounded types we specify the superclass of the type we want to allow. For example, for number
types the super class is Number. 
- The systax is


```java class numericClass<T extends Number>{ //T must be an instance of Number or its //subclass }

class anotherClass <T, V extends T>{ // in this class V must be instance of the same //class as T or
  subclass } ``` The notation `T extends BoundingType` means that T is subtype of bounding type.  In
  other words T implements BoundingType.  Here both T and the bounding type can be class or
  interface. **Note that evenif the bounding type is interface we are writing `extends` not
  implements**. 

tag-question: T and bounding types can be both class or interface. Are all the following scenarios
valid- a) interface extends interface b) class extends interface c) class implements interface
- there can be multiple bounds. There can be multiple interface as bounds but only one class and the
class must be the first bound.

`T extends Comparable & Serializable`


#### WildCard

It is best to describe with an example. Lets say we have a class like following- `class
numericItem<T extends Number>{

    boolean absEqual(numericItem<T> obj){}; }` 

the method compares two instance of numericItem. However, the method will not compile if we use
objects of different types i.e. numericItem<Double> and numericItem<Float>. To make this work we
need to use the wildcard as follows

`class numericItem<T extends Number>{ boolean absEqual(numericItem<?> obj){} }`


#### Bounded Wildcard

When we want to specify the upper type bound for a wildcard.

**Type argument can't be used in static context**

## Error Handling

- all exceptions are derived from "Throwable" class
- once an exception is handled, it is removed from the system. Therefore, the program can continue
its execution.
- in multiple catch block, put the super class exception at the very last. Put more specific
exceptions first.
- nested try block is possible. You may put code that can generate less serious error in the inner
try block, and put more serious error in the outer try. If an exception is not caught in the inner
try block, it is propagated to the outer try block.
- we can manually throw an exception and re-throw an already thrown exception.  One reason for
re-throwing an exception, is that different handler may work on different aspect of the exception. 
- "Throws" specifies that a method may throw an exception and doesn't handle it itself. So, the
calling method must handle the exception. We don't need to specify "throws" keyword for subclass of
Error or RuntimeException.
- Multi catch statement can handle more than one type of exception in a single catch block. the
systax is `catch (Exception type | ExceptionType e){...}`
- rethrow keyword restricts the type exception that can be rethrown. 
- chained exception- helps to identify one exception which is the cause of another exception.

## Collection

### Array List

- Efficient random access
- Dynamic size
- Java also has a Vector class. There is one important difference between ArrayList and Vector. All
methods of the Vector class is **Syschronized**. If we are using Vector in a single threaded
application, its better to use the ArrayList as the methods are not synchronized and hence are more
efficient.

tag:question- What is the overhead of synchronization? How to find that?

### Linked List

- In java all linked lists are doubly linked list.
- Linked list is an ordered list, all items are added at the end of the list
- If we want to add an element at middle of the list we have to use the ListIterator.
- If the iterator position is the biginning of the list the item is added at begining of the list
making it the new head. If the iterator position is the end of the list the item is added at the end
of the list making it the new tail.
- Linked list is not efficient for random access. Never use linked list for random access.
- Linked list provides a method `get()` to get element at a random position. But using it is
inefficient.

### HashSet

- Hash set is implemented by hash table
- Doesn't allow duplicate

### HashMap

Implements Map interface.

### TreeSet

[Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/TreeSet.html)

- TreeSet is implemented based on TreeMap
- the sorting is done using the Tree data structure specifically red-black tree
- adding an element is slower than HashSet but still much faster than array or linkedlist.

### Queue and Deque

- Efficient at adding element at the tail and removing element from the head. 
- Adding/ removing element from the middle is not allowed. 

### Priority Queue

- Items are added in random order but removed in sorted order. The smallest item is returned first. 
- Implemented using heap data structure

## Multithreading

- Thread class provides functionality for multithreading programming.
- We create an object of type Thread to create a new thread.
- To create a Thread object, we need a runnable object
- we can create a runnable object either by implementing the Runnable interface or by extending the
Thread class
- factory methods are useful in variety of situatiions. These methods return an instance of a class.
- we can use join() or isAlive() to join the threads. Thread can be terminated before join() is
executed. 
- we can prioratize threads. Giving a thread a higher priority means the thread has higher potential
to get cpu time.  Apart from priority, there are many factors those determies which gets cpu time.
For example, if a higher priority thread is waiting for some data, it will be blocked and lower
priority threads will get cpu time. It also depends on the os, how the os implements multitasking.
So, giving a thread a higher priority doesn't guarantee that it will get more cpu time, but there is
higher potential for the thread to get cpu time. 
- Synchronizing threads is needed if multiple threads access a shared resource or one thread depends
on the result produced by another thread. 
- In java, we do synchronizing, by using "synchronized" keyword. We use this keyword with the
methods. The rule is- when a thread enters a synchronized method, the object is locked and other
threads can't access any synchronized methods of the object. Once the method returns, the object is
unlocked and other threads can access the object.
- we can also use **synchronized block** to make synchronized call to a method.  We do this when we
are using an object which is not designed by us and the method is not declared as synchronized.
- thread pool

#### Event handler



#### Nested Class
- A class within a class
- two types of nested class- a) Static b) non-static(Inner)
- Inner class can be of two types- a)Local class b) Anonymous class
