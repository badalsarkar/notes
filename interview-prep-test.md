## data structures
- Linked list
- [graph](./graph-tree.md)
- Stacks and Queue
- Heaps
- Vectors
- ArrayList
- Hash Tables
- array
   - tips
      - use the array to reduce the space complexity to 0(1)
      - filling an array from front slow
         - if possible write from back
      - instead of deleting an entry, overwrite
      - when dealing with integers encoded by array, consider processing the digits from back or reverse the array so that least significant bit is first
      - when operating on 2D array use parallel logic on row and column

## algorithms
- breadth first search
- depth first search
- binary search
- merge sort
- quick sort
   - Sub title

## concepts
- bit manipulation
- memory (stack vs heap)
- recursion
- dynamic programming
- [[algorithm-complexity-analysis | time and space complexity]]
- [[images/power-of-2-table.png | power of 2 table]]
- OOP

## strategy
-
   - 1. Listen
-
   - 2. Example/ Test case
-
   - 3. Brute force
-
   -
      - 4. Optimize
   -
      - look for unused info from problem
      - solve and reverse engineer
      - solve incorrectly and ask why it fails
      - make time vs space trade offs
-
   - 5. Walk through
-
   - 6. Implement
-
   - 7. Test
